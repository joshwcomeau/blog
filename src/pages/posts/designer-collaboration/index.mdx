As developers, we're constantly looking for ways to increase our effectiveness. Naturally, we often reach for engineering solutions - frameworks, tooling, stuff-as-a-service. Typescript helps us catch bugs at compiletime so we don't have to spend time hunting for bugs at runtime. React hooks let me organize my business logic in a way that can be more intuitive, so my code stays simpler and I can get stuff done more quickly.

As a community, we've invested a lot in these engineering solutions. And they're great! I work at Gatsby, and our whole thing is to make it dramatically easier to develop rich, static-in-name-only web apps.

But we've picked a lot of the low-hanging fruit in this space. We've been mining this asteroid for a while now. It's worth seeing how else we might streamline and optimize our development processes.

When thinking about what I wanted to write for Javascript January, my goal was to produce something with a very high ROI.

Something interesting to think about: if you had 15 minutes with another developer, and your goal was to teach them something

This blog post should take you ~15 minutes to read, and my goal is to

And there's a lot of low-hanging fruit on other axes!

For example, communication with product and design.

# It starts with empathy

So here's a fun exercise. Imagine you're at a party, and someone asks what you do. You mention that you're a developer for Company X. The person pulls out their phone and navigates to Company X's homepage, which is a page you built.

For many devs, there's a certain amount of pride with this kind of thing. The code that we wrote is running on this person's phone! Even though undoubtedly many other people worked very hard on it, we were the ones who converted those efforts into a live, working page.

Now imagine that you're in the same situation, except you're the UI/UX designer who worked on Company X's homepage. The mockup you designed a few months ago is noticeably different from what you're seeing on this person's phone. The fonts are all wrong, the spacing is off, there's a weird glitch on scroll. This is your work, but there are caveats and asterisks.

Designers work hard to create a design that looks good and works well for the user. But then their work is filtered through the implementation process, which inevitably leaves some sort of mark. The end result will never exactly match their design. And yet, their professional reputation is all about which real-world products they've worked on, not how many beautiful, functional mockups they've designed.

This is a situation that can very easily lead to resentment and conflict. I've worked on teams where there was icy tension between designers and developers. And, frankly, I think developers are to blame most of the time. It's usually our fault.

There's another part to this as well.
