<p>
  If you had 15 minutes of a developer's time, and your goal was to boost their
  productivity, to help them be more effective at their job, what would you
  pick?
  <Asterisk>
    Framed another way, how would you fulfill the Geico promise: "15 minutes
    could save you 15% or more on development efforts"?
  </Asterisk>
</p>

This blog post is my answer to that question. It's roughly a 15 minute read, and I believe that if you take that time, it could potentially save you hundreds of hours of development effort throughout your career. I believe it's the highest-ROI tip I have, and I'm excited to talk about it :D

It's not about Javascript, though, or even about programming in general. As a community, we've done an incredible job optimizing along the engineering axis; we have brilliant frameworks, tools, and services. I work for Gatsby, and our whole focus is on making it dramatically faster to develop rich, performant, accessible web applications.

In other words, the kinds of problems we typically focus on have been well-harvested, and there's not as much low-hanging fruit left. But there are many other contributing factors to our output!

Most of the work we do on the front-end is intertwined with product and design. It's likely that you spend a good chunk of your time working on implementing the ideas that these team members deliver. Communication and trust play a huge role in how effectively we work together, and it can make an _enormous difference_ in our velocity.

# Rainbow Road

I used to work for [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org), a non-profit on a mission to provide a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.

I worked on the classroom team, building tools to be used by teachers and their students. We discovered pretty quickly that teachers really dislike having product updates shipped mid-semester; it disrupts their workflow, and eats up extremely limited time.

<p>
  For this and many other reasons, Khan Academy structured most of their
  releases around the "back-to-school" calendar: we aimed to have new stuff
  launched by July/August, in time for the new school year
  <Asterisk>(In the northern hemisphere)</Asterisk>. Especially on the classroom
  team, we couldn't ship new features after school started, so we had very firm deadlines.
</p>

In 2018, our squad worked on a project called _rainbow road_, centered around revamping the tools teachers used outside of class to understand what their students' needs were. Our plan was super aggressive: we were revamping 5 key product areas, and launching a bunch of new functionality. For a while, it was very unclear whether we would actually finish in time! In the end, we met all of our core commitments, though we had to do some creative scope-cutting.

# Three levers

A product manager once told me that he had _three levers_ he could pull on, in order to alleviate pressure when work is behind schedule:

- **People.** If a developer is overwhelmed with the amount of work they have to do, adding additional developers can help.
- **Time.** If the work is behind schedule, we can push the deadline back!
- **Scope.** If we can trim out some of the nice-to-haves, we can reduce the amount of work that needs to be done, while still delivering the critical experience, and solving for the original objective.

The first option, adding people, feels precarious to me. It can backfire; adding people doesn't always mean the work will get done faster. New developers need to gather a bunch of context, and sometimes that context exists only within the current developers' heads. Instead of speeding things up, it can slow everyone down.

The second option, time, might not be an option at all, especially if there are external, immovable deadlines. Some companies are reluctant to ever push deadlines back.

That leaves the third option, scope.

Scope cuts are generally decided by product managers, but they don't make that decision alone. It often starts with a conversation between the designer and the developer. If these two people trust each other, the process is collaborative, cordial, and productive. They figure out the best solution under the current constraints, taking development time and user experience into account, and then pitch it to the PM. If the PM trusts the designer and developer, and their proposed solution works from a product perspective, it's typically approved without any fuss.

This workflow is awesome, and I believe it was critical in our success in the _Rainbow Road_ project: if we weren't able to course-correct with so little friction, there's no way we would have been able to ship in time.

This workflow only works if all parties trust each other, though.

# It starts with empathy

So here's a fun exercise. Imagine you're at a party, and someone asks what you do. You mention that you're a developer for Company X. The person pulls out their phone and navigates to Company X's homepage, which is a page you built.

For many devs, there's a certain amount of pride with this kind of thing. The code that you wrote is running on this person's phone! Even though many other people worked very hard on it, you were the one who translated those efforts into a live, working page. It's your work.

Now imagine that you're in the same situation, except you're the UI/UX designer who worked on Company X's homepage. The mockup you designed a few months ago is noticeably different from what you're seeing on this person's phone. The fonts are all wrong, the spacing is off, there's a weird glitch on scroll. It's not really your work. Not without a lot of asterisks and caveats, at least.

Designers work hard to create a design that looks good and works well for the end user, but their work is funneled through an implementation process, one which inevitably leaves some kind of mark. The end result will never exactly match their design. Sometimes, it's worlds apart. And yet, their professional reputation is often all about which real-world products they've delivered, not how many beautiful mockups they've designed.

This is a situation that can very easily lead to resentment and conflict. I've worked on teams where there was a pervasive icy tension between designers and developers. And, frankly, I think developers are to blame most of the time. It's usually our fault.

It's worth recognizing that we haven't always been perfect teammates. The first step in building trust with our design and product friends is to show them that we take their concerns seriously.

# "Nits"

Let's say we're chugging along on a non-urgent feature. We push a version of the change up to staging, and a day or two later we get some feedback from the designer:

- Change avatar border radius from 4px to 8px
- Add 6px spacing below avatar
- Keep content center-aligned between `md` and `lg` breakpoints
- Title should be `gray-900`, not `gray-700`
- Text should show an ellipsis (...) if it's too long to fit on 3 lines.

We tend to describe these as "nitpicks" (which, incidentally, isn't a very kind way to describe this kind of feedback!). Generally what happens in these situations is that the developer tells the designer to create a ticket for these nits, where it'll likely be assigned a P4 and promptly forgotten about, amongst a sea of other low-priority tickets.

In rare cases—say, if we're a week from a looming deadline and crunching to fix critical bugs—we might not be able to give this feedback much attention at that moment. In general, though, how should we handle this situation?

### Collaborative implementation

First, we should figure out how much time we think it would take to fix these issues. Here's that list again:

- Change avatar border radius from 4px to 8px
- Add 6px spacing below avatar
- Keep content center-aligned between `md` and `lg` breakpoints
- Title should be `gray-900`, not `gray-700`
- Text should show an ellipsis (...) if it's too long to fit on 3 lines.

The first 4 tweaks sound relatively trivial to me (presuming that these changes are permitted within the constraints of the component library). I think it would take me about 5 minutes to fix them, maybe 30 minutes total when factoring in updating snapshot tests and going through code review.

The fifth one is tricky, though. If you've ever tried to deal with multi-line ellipsis on the web, you know that it's a dastardly problem with no simple CSS solution. You could easily spend an afternoon trying to get it sorted, and the solution would probably be janky.

In most cases, here's what I would do:

- Solve the first 4 problems
- Brainstorm about how I might address the designer's concern without needing a multi-line ellipsis
- DM the designer to get feedback.

The message I send might look something like this:

> Hi [designer friend],
>
> Thanks for the feedback for [project name]!
>
> I've tackled most of the issues you spotted, and they should be pushed to staging in [reasonable timeframe], but one issue is surprisingly tricky: browsers don't provide a good built-in way to handle showing an ellipsis for multi-line text. There are third-party solutions, but they tend to be finicky and unreliable.
>
> I had a couple ideas for potential alternatives:
>
> - It's possible with CSS to do a single-line ellipsis - what if we only showed the first line?
> - Maybe we could limit it by # of characters instead? Say, cap it to 120 characters, with an ellipsis if it's longer?
> - Maybe we can clamp the height of the container, and make the container scrollable? So we'd still show all the text, but ensure it doesn't take up too much space on-screen.
>
> Let me know what you think!

The key thing here is that it shows I am taking their concerns seriously.

Another thing: designers usually aren't familiar enough with the web platform to be able to tell what's easy and what's hard (and they shouldn't need to be, since this is _our_ job, not theirs). Multi-line ellipsis sounds like it should be easy, but we're saying it isn't. In effect, we're asking them to trust us.

Imagine if I had said something like this:

> Hi - I can't do the multiline ellipsis, it's too hard. Sorry.

The designer might wonder, "is this actually a hard thing, or are they making excuses because they don't want to deal with it?". They might think we're just giving them a canned line, so that we can get back to more-interesting work.

This is how trust is made or broken. Designers often work with many different developers; they can tell which developers are making an earnest effort to implement their feedback, and which ones aren't interested.

It's important that we establish a trusting relationship, because these are the same people we'll be talking with when we're a week from a deadline and we need to make hard choices about scope.

Scope discussions involve a negotiation between what's best for the user and what's feasible given the current development constraints. If the designer knows that you're earnestly trying to find the best solution, they'll likely be more receptive to alternative suggestions, and much more willing to collaborate on a solution. If the designer feels like you're just trying to do the minimum possible, though, they'll likely stand firm and insist that the design is followed precisely.

# Covert operations

In the above example, I took the liberty of spending half an hour on implementing design feedback. You'll notice that I didn't check with my manager or the team lead, I just went for it.

Depending on where you work, you may or may not have this kind of autonomy. At some organizations, it may be considered unusual for developers to work on tickets that weren't explicitly assigned by a PM.

If you work in an environment like this, designers probably don't have any expectation that you'll address these concerns, so it's a bit of a different situation. Good communication is the most important part; you can still have that discussion around workarounds and optimal solutions, even if you're not authorized to implement the fixes yet.

I also have a little trick I really like; if I finish a task early and have some extra time to spare, I'll DM a team member and ask if they have any lingering tickets they'd like me to look at. It could be a designer, or a member of the support team, or someone in sales.

Often, folks will have a couple of tickets that are very important to them, and yet those tickets never seem to find their way into the active sprint. Typically, the reply I get will look like:

> OMG YES I've been trying to get this ticket solved for 3 months, it's affecting a lot of users and I don't understand why it isn't being taken more seriously. Thank you thank you thank you.

In these cases, I like to pretend that I'm on an undercover mission - I won't usually fuss with tickets, and I won't broadcast that I'm working on it (though of course I'll still be honest if anyone asks, and I'll bring it up in a subsequent standup).

It's worth pointing out that as a cis white guy, I am privileged enough that I can get away with stuff like this without worrying about any repercussions. Unfortunately, your experience might vary, especially if you're an underrepresented minority in tech. A safer bet might be to reach out to your PM and ask for permission first, instead of forgiveness later.

# "Should designers code?"

Every few months, this question is asked on Design Twitter, and everyone jumps in with hot takes. I am not a designer, and am woefully out of my depth when it comes to answering this question, but I do have one strong opinion: designers should be allowed to code _if_ they want to. And if so, developers should lend a hand.

I've worked on teams where designers knew CSS, and wanted to be able to make small tweaks, stuff like adjusting font sizes and positions. Sometimes, developers are hesitant—there's a concern that it will eat up a bunch of their time. After all, the codebase is complex, and there are a lot of quirky conventions that make it hard to make small CSS changes.

My perspective is that we can't have it both ways; either we agree to promptly address any design feedback we receive, _or_ we find a way to empower designers to make those changes themselves (if they want to). While it might take a bit more developer time upfront, it's an investment in the future. And it allows our teammates to accomplish their goals. Good teammates help each other with stuff like that.

It's a bit of a sad statement that designers are sometimes willing to learn an _entirely different trade_ because they see it as the easiest way to make sure that their designs are correctly implemented 😬

Also, we shouldn't underestimate designers' ability to make sense of our code. Yes, coding is hard, but it's not as mystical as we like to believe. I'll never forget the time I showed a QA person how to do localhost database modifications himself with Node, and he looked at me like, "really? That's all there is to it?".

# Deeper collaboration during development

The conventional way to build software was a multi-step process: first, design did all the user research and sketching and prototyping and creating high fidelity mockups. Once they were confident their work was finished, they'd toss it over the wall to the development team, and wouldn't hear anything about it until it was just about ready to go live.

As I'm sure many people have experienced, this is not an ideal way to work. As developers, we have critical information needed for a successful design process. We know what data is and isn't available in our database. We understand the web platform and its limitations. In short, we know which ideas will be easy to implement, and which will be next-to-impossible.

Happily, the industry is moving to a more agile model, where developers are involved earlier. There's no more rude awakenings when a design that has spent months being polished is immediately tossed back over the wall because it's not possible to implement.

But this is only half of the story. It's also critically important that design remains actively involved throughout implementation!

Many developers work in isolation, and they keep the feature pretty close to the chest until it's nearly finished. This can lead to a number of not-great scenarios:

- The developer might have missed the fact that there was an on-enter animation specified, and that animation totally isn't possible with their code's structure
- The designer might suddenly realize, seeing it populated with real data, that a bunch of their original assumptions were wrong, and that this all needs to be rethought.
- The developer might have misunderstood how the views should scale _between_ the specified screen sizes.
- The designer might not have known that there would be a 3-second loading spinner before the main view loaded. After discussion, the designer learns that the slowest piece of data is the least important. A new design is produced, removing the slow piece of data, and rearranging everything else to make it work.
- A million other things like this.

In all of these scenarios, how much time could have been saved by having a designer involved earlier?

When I'm working on a feature, I'm constantly asking questions and sending GIFs. When possible, I deploy frequently to staging, so that designers can play with the feature themselves.

A static mockup can never perfectly capture the essence of using a product, and designers sometimes need to see how it _feels_ before they have conidence in their approach. The sooner we can get a prototype in the designer's hands, the earlier we'll know if there's a problem, and the less work we'll have to do.

# Develop a design intuition

There's a pervasive myth that design and development are polar opposites, and that they're mutually exclusive skills. Design is seen as creative and artistic and abstract, whereas development is seen as logical and rational and concrete.

I think that's all wrong. Design, like music and everything else, has rules and constraints and predictable outcomes. Sure, there's a human element of infusing those rules with creativity and personality, but the same thing can be said for development! If programming was as rational and concrete as people say, we wouldn't waste so much time trying to convince everyone else that _our_ way of doing things is the best way.

Also, I submit Exhibit B: _creative coding_:

You may think that you'd be "bad at design" because you're bad at drawing, or don't feel like a particularly artistic person, but I promise you that the fundamentals are more more rooted in logic and math than you think. And I think developing a rudimentary level of design skill can be incredibly powerful, for a bunch of reasons:

- If you work on side-projects, or like the idea of starting something, you likely won't be able to afford a designer, and yet you probably still want it to be well-designed.
- It teaches you a common language you can share with designers, a way to communicate more effectively, about things like [affordance](https://uxplanet.org/ux-design-glossary-how-to-use-affordances-in-user-interfaces-393c8e9686e4) and [information architecture](https://uxplanet.org/information-architecture-basics-for-designers-b5d43df62e20).
- It gives you additional ways to leverage your intuition.

That last one is interesting, and worth digging into a little bit.

Whether you realize it or not, you're constantly making design decisions, and relying on your intuition. Mockups are never feature-complete, and in the process of implementing them, we'll find dozens or hundreds of little things not explicitly specified in the mockup.

I've been honing my design intuition for years, and I believe I have a pretty good instinct for most things now. It's been a fantastic investment. I can use my judgment for most things that come along. I still reach out with questions, but my questions tend to be higher-level now, more around structure and flow rather than pixel positions.

In order to start developing your design instinct, I have a couple tips:

- If your organization has a design system, spend some time learning _why_ things are the way they are. For example, you might have a `<Button>` component with different types: `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`. Design systems will often be very explicit about which type should be used when.
- Speak with your designers! Try and learn more about why they structured things the way they did. Instead of simply absorbing what they've specified, try and understand why they've specified it.

Integrating these habits into your existing workflow should offer pretty noticeable benefits without a ton of extra investment, but if you're really into this idea, here are some resources that could prove helpful:

- [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book/), a book written by a designer specifically for developers.

# Conclusion

It's early in the new decade, and many of us have goals to improve our developer skills. Technical ability is undoubtedly important, but it's only 1 aspect to being a good developer, and we often overlook other aspects that are just as important.

When folks talk about the "10x developer", I often worry they're imagining a developer who writes code 10x faster than a normal developer (or, worse, a dev who writes 10x the amount of code 😬). What I imagine is a developer who provides 10x the _value_ to an organization. And developers who are effective collaborators with design provide a _ton_ of value.

The premise of this blog post is that a 15-minute read could save you a ton of development effort in the future, and I hope I've accomplished that goal. This post has a sneaky ulterior motive, though: I want us to start pulling our weight when it comes to design-developer collaboration. You may feel like "pixel pushing" is a tedious drag, that you wish you could spend all your time on business logic and code architecture and performance optimizations... But that's no excuse to half-ass it. Our design team deserves partners who take implementation as seriously as they do.
