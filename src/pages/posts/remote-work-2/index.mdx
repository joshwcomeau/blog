For the past year or so, I've had the privilege of working with a local coding bootcamp. One of the things I do is career coaching: I help recent graduates find their first job.

The most common obstacle they face is the chicken-and-egg problem: to get a job, you need experience. But to get experience, you need a job.

Remote work presents a similar challenge. Even if you have some experience working in-office, remote-friendly jobs like to hire folks who have a proven track record of being able to work remotely.

This is also a two-way street; in addition to the employer wondering if you'd make a capable remote worker, you should wonder if the employer is well-set-up for remote work. Not all remote-friendly companies are equally friendly to remote workers.

This blog post shares everything I've learned so far about finding high-quality remote gigs, and getting an offer from them. It's the second post in a series, and they're meant to be read in order.

# Finding remote options

Alright, step 1: How do we even find remote jobs?

There are a number of ways:

- Remote job boards, like [Remote OK](https://remoteok.io/),
- "Big lists", like [this Github repo](https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs), and [this ginormous Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TLJSlNxCbwRNxy14Toe1PYwbCTY7h0CNHeer9J0VRzE/edit#gid=1279011369)
- HackerNews' [Who's Hiring](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21683554) posts (You can do a page-wide search for 'remote' to jump through remote-friendly ones).

These methods excel at quantity, but to be honest, I've never had much success with them. I'm sure that many of these organizations are wonderful, but it's a bit overwhelming to me. Feels like looking for a needle in a haystack.

Instead, I've had more success by keeping an eye open, and doing my own research. I'm [active on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) - when someone posts something cool, I'll creep their profile, see where they work, and research that company. When I stumble upon a cool product in my day-to-day life, I'll do the same (when I discovered Notion earlier this year, I emailed the founder to see if they were open to a remote applicant - sadly they weren't ☹️). Over the past few years I've come up with a list of fantastic companies with friendly remote policies:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) (disclaimer: I work here now)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) (disclaimer: I worked here before)
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) (disclaimer: I worked here before too)
- [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/)
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
- [Webflow](https://webflow.com/)
- [Zeit](https://zeit.co/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)
- [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/)

Other folks on Twitter have their own lists, like [this one](https://twitter.com/chris_herd/status/1202962206226292736).

> **This list is only meant as an example;** feel free to check them out, but the real point is that you should start working on your own list. I can't actually vouch for most of the companies on this list, and there are plenty of other amazing orgs out there.

# Evaluating remote-friendliness

It's very easy for companies to update an online job posting to allow for remote work, but it's much harder for companies to create a company with policies and culture that treat remote workers well.

This section looks at how to evaluate a company from the perspective of a remote worker.

### Level of distribution

The first question I always ask when trying to evaluate an organization: what % of the company is remote?

If the company only has one or two remote workers, it's almost a guarantee that all elements of the culture are biased for in-office workers. These kinds of arrangements can still work, but it's a much steeper hill to climb. By contrast, some organizations are fully distributed - they have no head office, every employee works from their own environment. Entire categories of problems evaporate with this kind of arrangement.

If you've read [Part I](/posts/remote-work/) of this series, you've seen that I've run into a few problems in my remote career:

- Video-conferencing stress
- Career progression challenges
- Communication problems

These issues (and many others!) tend to disappear as an organization moves further towards the "distributed" end of the spectrum. It's hard to overstate the importance of finding an organization that is more remote than not, especially for first-time remote workers.

A bonus question you can ask: is the company remote-friendly "all the way up"? Are there members of the exec team working remotely, or is it only engineers and designers who work remotely? It's a bit of a red flag, in my opinion, if only individual contributors are remote.

### Remote integration

If the company is not fully distributed, it's important to figure out whether remote work is treated as a first-class concern, or whether it's an afterthought. When designing company policies, are remote workers top-of-mind? Is remote work a core part of the culture?

If a company has a public handbook / onboarding doc, it's worth looking through. Glitch's handbook, for example, has an [entire section](https://handbook.glitch.me/#distributed-working) dedicated to distributed work, and references to remote work are sprinkled throughout the handbook:

> We are a proudly distributed team, so the way we communicate shapes our shared virtual workplace. In order to work effectively across multiple teams, we narrate our work so that our colleagues and customers understand what decisions we are making and why. This means sharing mistakes and lessons with one another to encourage accountability and welcome feedback.

If a company doesn't have public documents like this, you can probably get a sense peripherally by asking questions around communication and workflow. Remote work should come up naturally in conversation quite a bit.

### Meetings

If a company is half-remote, it means that a 10-person meeting will typically include 5 people in the same space, and 5 folks calling in. This can produce an awkward dynamic, where the employees in the same room are more likely to talk with each other. If there are no lulls in the conversation, it can be hard to jump in as a remote participant.

There are a couple strategies for mitigating this:

- A "remote champion" can be designated. This in-office person is responsible for keeping an eye on the chat, and interjecting if it looks like a remote participant has something to say, and making sure to explicitly check in with remote folks every few minutes for comments.
- Everyone in the meeting can call in from their own device. This way, even if folks are in the same room together, they're all communicating through a screen, same as remote participants. This can level the playing field a bit.

The first solution is dependent on having someone who doesn't mind playing that role; it would be pretty mean to foist it upon someone shy. If there's someone willing to fill that role, it can work well.

The second solution can greatly increases the load placed on the network; if there are 5 in-office participants, it requires 5 times the amount of bandwidth! This is a non-trivial problem for the company to solve, and it's exactly the kind of strong signal I'm looking for; companies should be willing to solve stuff like this for their remote employees!

I'm always sure to ask remote companies how they make sure remote folks are included in the conversation in meetings. It would be a big red flag to me if companies haven't thought about this problem.

### Getting the team together

A common misconception around remote work is that it's a solo activity. In my experience, it involves a ton of collaboration! Even though I'm not in the same space as my co-workers, I still need to collaborate with product and design to hash out implementation details, or pair-program with another developer to figure out a gnarly problem.

This kind of collaboration is easiest when you have a personal relationship with your co-workers, and it's easiest to develop that kind of relationship in-person. For this reason, it's important that companies have regular opportunities for the whole team to meet and hang out in-person.

Be sure to ask whether the company values these kinds of interactions, through regular team offsites, or a flexible policy around visiting HQ. Ideally the company won't have a limit on how often employees can visit, but if there is a maximum, it should be 3x a year or higher.

### Working hours

One of the trickiest parts about working on a distributed team is that not everyone is in the same timezone. This presents a challenge around scheduling meetings; how do you ensure you aren't scheduling a meeting during someone's dinner, or at the crack of dawn?

Some companies restrict remote work to a somewhat narrow band. For example, some companies only hire folks working within primary North American timezones, which represents a 3-hour range. Then, a policy ensures that meetings can only be scheduled during the 5 hours of overlap (between 9am and 2pm for west-coast folks, which is 12pm to 5pm for those on the east-coast). This felt like a fair policy to me.

If the company hires globally, this gets a lot more challenging; there aren't any hours of overlap in the workday between folks in California and folks in Berlin, for example. It's all well and good to put more emphasis on asynchronous communication, but it's harder to work effectively without ever being able to speak to someone over a video call.

One solution for this involves scheduling duplicate meetings, so that folks can pick the one that works for their timezone. This does mean that folks running those meetings need to get up early and/or stay late.

When interviewing, be sure to ask which hours of the day are "fair game" for meetings, and be sure that the answer is something you're comfortable with.

### International work

I'm Canadian, and I've worked for 3 American companies. Happily, this doesn't involve any sort of US VISA.

There are two ways that this kind of work can be structured:

- The company can set up a Canadian subsidiary. This is often a very thin construct (just some paperwork and a PO Box), but it allows the organization to hire Canadians as employees - payroll income tax is deducted, health benefits can be provided, and the employer must abide by Canadian labor laws (minimum 2 weeks vacation, etc). It's the same thing as working for a Canadian company.
- The company can hire international workers as contractors. Workers bill the company for their time, and don't enjoy any of the legal protections and benefits afforded to full-time employees. It can also make income taxes more complicated, though it does come with some tax benefits as well (such as having access to a wider set of deductions).

Going the subsidiary route can be a pretty tall order for companies, especially for smaller orgs who don't have a ton of Canadian employees. For fully international companies, it becomes untenable, since every country has their own complicated set of laws and restrictions.

For a lot of people, the contractor route is a deal-breaker. Companies are rarely forthcoming with this information, so it's best to ask upfront. You don't want to get through a grueling gauntlet of interviews only to learn that it's a contract gig.
