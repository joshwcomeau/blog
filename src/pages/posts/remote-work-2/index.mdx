For the past year or so, I've had the privilege of working with a local coding bootcamp. One of the things I do is career coaching: I help recent graduates find their first job.

The most common obstacle they face is the chicken-and-egg problem: to get a job, you need experience. But to get experience, you need a job.

import chickenEggSrc from '../../../assets/images/job-chicken-egg.jpg';

<img
  src={chickenEggSrc}
  style={{ width: '50%', maxWidth: 'calc(100vw - 64px)', marginBottom: '2rem' }}

Remote work presents a similar challenge. Even if you have some experience working in-office, remote-friendly jobs like to hire folks who have a proven track record of being able to work remotely.

This is also a two-way street; in addition to the employer wondering if you'd make a capable remote worker, you should wonder if the employer is well-set-up for remote work. Not all remote-friendly companies are equally friendly to remote workers.

This blog post shares everything I've learned so far about finding high-quality remote gigs, and getting an offer from them. It's the second post in a series, and they're meant to be read in order.

# Finding remote options

Alright, step 1: How do we even find remote jobs?

There are a number of ways:

- Remote job boards, like [Remote OK](https://remoteok.io/),
- "Big lists", like [this Github repo](https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs), and [this ginormous Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TLJSlNxCbwRNxy14Toe1PYwbCTY7h0CNHeer9J0VRzE/edit#gid=1279011369)
- HackerNews' [Who's Hiring](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21683554) posts (You can do a page-wide search for 'remote' to jump through remote-friendly ones).

These methods excel at quantity, but to be honest, I've never had much success with them. I'm sure that many of these organizations are wonderful, but it's a bit overwhelming to me. Feels like looking for a needle in a haystack.

Instead, I've had more success by keeping an eye open, and doing my own research. I'm [active on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) - when someone posts something cool, I'll creep their profile, see where they work, and research that company. When I stumble upon a cool product in my day-to-day life, I'll do the same (when I discovered Notion earlier this year, I emailed the founder to see if they were open to a remote applicant - sadly they weren't ☹️). Over the past few years I've come up with a list of fantastic companies with friendly remote policies:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) (disclaimer: I work here now)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) (disclaimer: I worked here before)
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) (disclaimer: I worked here before too)
- [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/)
- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
- [Webflow](https://webflow.com/)
- [Zeit](https://zeit.co/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)
- [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/)

**This list is only meant as an example;** feel free to check them out, but the real point is that you should start working on your own list. I also can't vouch for all the companies on this list; I only know a tiny bit about Mozilla's policies, for example.

# Red flags

Here are some things I watch out for, when looking into a company:

### Not very remote

Sometimes, a company will have a strong preference for on-site workers, and will allow remote applications only for high-skill, low-supply niches, or exceptional candidates. This is a _huge_ red flag.

Remote friendliness is a spectrum, from "one or two remote folks" to "distributed company with no head office". As a general rule, you want to be as close to fully-distributed as possible.

If you've read [Part I](/posts/remote-work/) of this series, you've seen that I've run into a few problems in my remote career:

- Video-conferencing stress, when chatting with a buncha folks in-office
- Career progression challenges, perceived favoritism for onsite folks
- Potential for vital "off-slack" communication

All of these issues pretty much go away when the entire company is distributed.

As a general rule, you want to work for a company with a high % of remote workers - greater than 50%, if possible. You don't want to be the only remote person on your team. In special circumstances this can work, but it's much harder.

### Thoughtful policies

It's important to determine whether the company you're looking at treats remote work as a first-class concern, or whether it's an afterthought. When designing policies, are remote workers top-of-mind?

If a company has a public handbook / onboarding doc, it's worth looking through. Glitch's handbook, for example, has an [entire section](https://handbook.glitch.me/#distributed-working) dedicated to distributed work, and references to remote work are sprinkled throughout the handbook:

> **Meetings** - We try to keep meetings to a minimum and when we do have them, they're well-organized with a specific agenda. Every meeting is remote-first, with every person in the meeting joining on video chat — even if they're based in HQ.

**Join the newsletter to make sure you don't miss it.** I expect it to be published in a week or two.

I talk about remote work quite a bit [**on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau), so be sure to follow me there if this kind of stuff is your jam. I also share cute animals and React stuff.
