      First off - woohoo! This is my first published post on the new blog. I'm
      super excited. Thanks for checking it out! ðŸ¥‚
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      While building this blog, I wanted it to feel whimsical, with plenty of
      charming interactions and animations. I built this while working on my
      React Europe talk,{' '}
      <TextLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2d9rw9RwyE">
        The Case for Whimsy
      </TextLink>, and so it was very much on my mind.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      For example, did you notice that as you started scrolling on this page,
      the BÃ©zier curves that border the green title hero thingy started
      flattening? Keep your eye on the swoopy curves just above the post text as
      you scroll through the top of the document. Notice how they become flat as
      they approach the header at the top of the viewport?
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      In a delightful bit of serendipity, I realized while building the blog
      that this feature would make a great first blog post!
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The whole reason I started this blog was that I wanted a way to build
      dynamic, interactive articles that are more effective at sharing and
      teaching concepts. Unlike with plain text on Medium, this blog is a
      fully-powered React app, and so I can create and embed interactive
      elements that help the reader build an intuitive understanding of the
      subject being presented. These dynamic "flattenable" BÃ©zier curves are a
      perfect subject for this format, as they have underlying complexity that
      would be difficult to explain with words alone.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      In this maiden blog post, we'll go through the basics of working with
      BÃ©zier curves and SVG in React.js. We'll learn how to build dynamic curves
      that respond to user input:

    <SectionHeading anchorId="understanding-svg-paths">

    </SectionHeading>
    <Paragraph>
      For achieving this effect, we'll use SVG. We could also use HTML Canvas,
      but I generally prefer to work with SVG. It's more React-like in its API,
      there's less complexity in setting it up, and it's more a11y-friendly.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      While doing a deep dive into SVG is beyond the scope of this post (I'd
      recommend the{' '}
      <TextLink href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp">
        W3Schools tutorial

      for that), we'll cover the basics, and show how to create some shapes from
      scratch. Experienced SVG-ers can jump to{' '}
      <TextLink href="#intro-to-bezier-curves">the next section</TextLink>.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The simplest form of SVG drawings use shape elements, like{' '}
      <InlineCode>{'<rect>'}</InlineCode> or{' '}
      <InlineCode>{'<ellipse>'}</InlineCode>.

    <Paragraph>
      These shapes are straightforward and declarative, but that simplicity
      comes at the cost of flexibility; you can only create a handful of
      different shapes.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      To do neat curvy things, we need to use the{' '}
      <InlineCode>{'<path>'}</InlineCode> element. This swiss-army-knife of an
      SVG primitive lets you specify a sequence of steps to execute, in a
      seemingly-inscrutable bundle of letters and numbers:
    </Paragraph>
    <LiveEditableCode
      id="path-intro"
      gistId="27a7f8f1b1a8dcd93d4330b90a7dcc86"
      code={pathIntroCode}
    />
    <Paragraph>The interactive code snippet above uses 2 commands:</Paragraph>
    <List>
      <ListItem>
        <InlineCode>M</InlineCode>, which instructs the path to <Em>move</Em> to
        a specific coordinate.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        <InlineCode>L</InlineCode>, which instructs the path to create a{' '}
        <Em>line</Em> from the current position to the specified coordinate.
      </ListItem>
    </List>
    <Paragraph>
      After the commands <InlineCode>M</InlineCode> and{' '}
      <InlineCode>L</InlineCode>, we see some numbers. These can be thought of
      as "arguments" for the commands. In this case, the arguments are
      coordinates; both commands require a single X/Y pair.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In other words, we can read the above path as: "Move to{' '}
      <InlineCode>{'{x: 100, y: 100}'}</InlineCode>, then draw a line to{' '}
      <InlineCode>{'{x: 200, y: 100}'}</InlineCode>", and so on.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The coordinate system is relative to the values specified in the{' '}
      <InlineCode>viewBox</InlineCode>. The current viewbox specifies that the
      viewable area has a top-left corner of 0/0, a width of 300, and a height
      of 300. So all of the coordinates specified in the{' '}
      <InlineCode>path</InlineCode> are within that 300x300 box.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The <InlineCode>viewBox</InlineCode> is what makes SVGs scalable; we can
      make our SVG any size we like, and everything will scale naturally, since
      the elements within our SVG are relative to this 300x300 box.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The <InlineCode>path</InlineCode> element features{' '}
      <TextLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths">
        quite a number
      </TextLink>{' '}
      of these commands. There are two that are relevant for our purposes:
    </Paragraph>
    <List>
      <ListItem>
        <InlineCode>Q</InlineCode>, which instructs the path to create a{' '}
        <Em>quadratic</Em> BÃ©zier curve.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        <InlineCode>C</InlineCode>, which instructs the path to create a{' '}
        <Em>cubic</Em> BÃ©zier curve.
      </ListItem>
    </List>
    <Spacer size={80} />
    <SectionHeading anchorId="intro-to-bezier-curves">
      Intro to BÃ©zier Curves
    </SectionHeading>
    <Paragraph>
      BÃ©zier curves are surprisingly common. Due to their versatility, they're a
      staple in most graphics software like Photoshop, but they're also used as
      timing functions: if you've ever used non-linear CSS transitions (like the
      default "ease"), you've already worked with BÃ©zier curves!
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>But what are they, and how do they work?</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      A BÃ©zier curve is essentially a line from a <Em>start point</Em> to an{' '}
      <Em>end point</Em> that is acted upon by one or more{' '}
      <Em>control points</Em>. A control point curves the line towards it, as if
      the control point was pulling it in its direction.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The following line looks like a straight line, but check out what happens
      when you move the points aroundâ€”try dragging the middle control point up
      and down.
    </Paragraph>
    <BezierController id="initial" initialType="quadratic" />
    <Paragraph>
      The line above is a <Em>quadratic</Em> BÃ©zier curve; this means that it
      has a <strong>single control point</strong>. I'm guessing it gets its name
      from the fact that you can create parabola-like shapes with it:
    </Paragraph>
    <BezierController
      id="parabola"
      initialType="quadratic"
      p1={[400, 15]}
      p2={[500, 395]}
      p4={[600, 15]}
    />
    <Paragraph>
      A <Em>cubic</Em> BÃ©zier curve, in contrast, has <strong>two</strong>{' '}
      control points. This allows for much more interesting curves:
    </Paragraph>
    <BezierController
      id="toggleable"
      allowToggle
      initialType="cubic"
      p1={[25, 25]}
      p2={[333, 375]}
      p3={[666, 25]}
      p4={[975, 375]}
    />
    <Paragraph>
      The syntax for BÃ©zier curves in SVG <InlineCode>path</InlineCode>{' '}
      definitions is a little counter-intuitive, but it looks like this:
    </Paragraph>
    <LiveEditableCode
      id="bezier-path"
      gistId="1720d55b885e61dc070a59fabc500142"
      code={bezierPathCode}
    />
    <Paragraph>
      The thing that makes this counter-intuitive, to me at least, is that the{' '}
      <InlineCode>startPoint</InlineCode> is inferred in the{' '}
      <InlineCode>Q</InlineCode> command; while there are 3 points needed for a
      quadratic BÃ©zier curve, only 2 points are passed as arguments to{' '}
      <InlineCode>Q</InlineCode>.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Similarly, for a cubic BÃ©zier curve, only the control points and the end
      point are provided to the <InlineCode>C</InlineCode> command.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      This syntax does mean that curves can conveniently be chained together, as
      one curve starts where the last one ends:
    </Paragraph>
    <LiveEditableCode
      id="chained-curves"
      gistId="5f7315ec4751cf2dadb5ba41f037dcdc"
      code={chainedCurvesCode}
    />
    <Paragraph>
      Ok, I think that's enough playing with vanilla SVGs. Let's see how we can
      leverage React to make these curves dynamic!
    </Paragraph>

    <SectionHeading anchorId="bezier-curves-in-react">

      Up to this point, we've been looking at static SVGs. How do we make them
      change, over time or based on user input?
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Well, in keeping with the "meta" theme of this blog post, why not examine
      the draggable-with-lines BÃ©zier curves from earlier in this post?
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      There's a fair bit of code to manage this, even in this
      slightly-simplified snippet. I've annotated it heavily, which hopefully
      makes things easier to parse. ðŸ¤ž

    <Paragraph>To summarize how this works:</Paragraph>
    <List>
      <ListItem>
        React holds variables in component state for{' '}
        <InlineCode>startPoint</InlineCode>,{' '}
        <InlineCode>controlPoint</InlineCode>, and{' '}
        <InlineCode>endPoint</InlineCode>.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        In the <Em>render</Em> method, we build the instructions for the{' '}
        <InlineCode>path</InlineCode> using these state variables.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        When the user clicks or taps on one of the points, we update the state
        to keep track of which point is moving with{' '}
        <InlineCode>draggingPointId</InlineCode>.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        As the user moves the mouse (or finger) across the SVG's surface, we do
        some calculations to figure out where the currently-dragging point needs
        to move to. This is made complex by the fact that SVGs have their own
        internal coordinate system (viewBox), and so we have to translate the
        on-screen pixels to this system.
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem>
        Once we have the new X/Y coordinate for the active point,{' '}
        <InlineCode>setState</InlineCode> lets React know about this state
        change, and the component re-renders, which causes the{' '}
        <InlineCode>path</InlineCode> to be re-calculated.

    <SectionSubHeading anchorId="a-note-on-performance">
      A note on performance
    </SectionSubHeading>
    <Paragraph>
      By using React's update cycle to manage the point coordinates, there is
      added overhead of letting React run its reconciliation cycle on every{' '}
      <InlineCode>mousemove</InlineCode>. Is this prohibitively expensive?
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The answer is that it depends. React's reconciliation can be surprisingly
      fast, especially when dealing with such a small tree (after all, the only
      thing that needs to be diffed is an SVG). Especially in "production" mode,
      when React doesn't have to do a lot of dev warning checks, this process
      can take fractions of a millisecond.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      I wrote an{' '}

      that updates the DOM directly. It does run faster (about 50% faster in my
      quick test), but both implementations still clock in under 1ms on modern
      high-end hardware. On the cheapest Chromebook I could find, the
      "unoptimized" one still averaged 50fps or so.

      Curve Interpolation
    </SectionHeading>
    <Paragraph>
      I seem to have gotten a little side-tracked! Our original goal was to
      create a BÃ©zier curve that flattens itself on scroll.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Given what we've gone over so far, we have almost all of the tools we need
      to solve this problem! A BÃ©zier curve with its control point(s) directly
      between the start and end points is actually a straight line! So we need
      to transition the control points from their curvy values to a flat value.
    </Paragraph>
    <BezierFlattener />
    <Spacer size={32} />
    <Paragraph>
      We need a way to <Em>interpolate values</Em>. We know where the control
      points should be at 0% and 100%, but what about when the user is 25%
      scrolled through the content?
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      While we could be fancy and ease the transition, a linear transformation
      works just fine for our purposes. So when the user is 50% scrolled through
      the content, the control points will be 50% of the way between their
      initial curvy value, and the flat-line value.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      For this, some secondary-school maths will come in handy. If you're
      already up to speed on interpolation, you can{' '}
      <TextLink href="#handling-scroll-in-react">skip this bit</TextLink>.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      If you plumb the depths of your memory, you may remember how to calculate
      the <Em>slope</Em> of a line. The slope tells you how the line changes
      over time. We calculate it by dividing the{' '}
      <strong>
        change in <Latex>y</Latex>
      </strong>{' '}
      over the{' '}
      <strong>
        change in <Latex>x</Latex>
      </strong>:
    </Paragraph>
    <Latex block>{'slope = \\frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1} = \\frac{Î”y}{Î”x}'}</Latex>
    <Paragraph>
      There's also this rascal, the linear equation formula. This allows us to
      graph a straight line, and figure out the <Latex>y</Latex> value for a
      given <Latex>x</Latex> value. By convention, slope is given the variable{' '}
      <Latex>a</Latex>:
    </Paragraph>
    <Latex block>y = ax + b</Latex>
    <Paragraph>
      How does this relate to interpolation? Well, let's imagine that our BÃ©zier
      curve's control point, when it's all curvy, is <Latex>200</Latex> pixels
      away from its flattened position, so we'll give it an initial{' '}
      <Latex>y</Latex> value of <Latex>200</Latex>. The <Latex>x</Latex> in this
      case is really a measure of progress, so we'll have it range from{' '}
      <Latex>0</Latex> (completely curvy) to <Latex>1</Latex> (completely flat).
      If we graph this line, we get this:
    </Paragraph>
    <BezierInterpolationGraph />

    <Paragraph>
      To clarify, this line represents the range of possible <Latex>y</Latex>{' '}
      values for a quadratic BÃ©zier curve's control point. Our <Latex>x</Latex>{' '}
      values represent the degree of "flattening"; this is useful to us because
      we want to be able to provide an <Latex>x</Latex> value like{' '}
      <Latex>0.46</Latex>, and figure out what the corresponding{' '}
      <Latex>y</Latex> value is (our <Latex>x</Latex> value will come from user
      input, like the percentage scrolled through the viewport).
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      To make our formula work, we need to know at least 2 points on this line.
      Thankfully, we do! We know that the initial position, fully curved, is at{' '}
      <InlineCode>{`{ x: 0, y: 200 }`}</InlineCode>, and we know that the curve
      becomes fully flattened at <InlineCode>{`{ x: 1, y: 0 }`}</InlineCode>.
    </Paragraph>
    <List>
      <ListItem>
        The slope would be equal to{' '}
        <Latex>
          {'\\frac{Î”y}{Î”x} = \\frac{0 - 200}{1 - 0} = \\frac{-200}{1} = -200'}
        </Latex>.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Our <Latex>b</Latex> value is the y-axis intercept, which is our initial
        curved value, <Latex>200</Latex>.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        <Latex>x</Latex> will be the ratio of scroll-through, between 0 and 1,
        that we'll get from our scroll handler.
      </ListItem>
    </List>
    <Paragraph>Filling it in:</Paragraph>
    <Latex block>{'y = -200x + 200'}</Latex>
    <Paragraph>
      If it's 25% of the way through, <Latex>x</Latex> will be 0.25, and so our{' '}
      <Latex>y</Latex> value would be{' '}
      <Latex>y = (-200)(0.25) + 200 = 150</Latex>, which is correct: 150 is 1/4
      of the way between 200 and 0.
    </Paragraph>

      Here's our function that performs the above calculations:

      values to a BÃ©zier curve in the <Em>render</Em> function:
    </Paragraph>
    <LiveEditableCode
      id="react-scroll-flattener"
      gistId="9e3fa23fb1f291ee781ed110b6cb7843"
      scope={{ getInterpolatedValue, PropTypes }}
      size="extra-wide"
      code={reactScrollFlattenerCode}
      maxHeight={650}
    />
    <Paragraph>
      This initial approach seems to work OK! There are two things I want to
      improve though:
    </Paragraph>
    <List>
      <ListItem>
        The "timing" of the flattening feels wrong to me.
        <br />
        <Spacer size={10} />
        When the curve fully enters the viewport, it's already starting to be
        flattened. We don't get to see it in 100%-curved form. Worse, it hasn't
        finished flattening by the time it scrolls out of view! This is because
        this page has a header that takes up the top 50px of the viewport, and
        we aren't taking that into account.
        <br />
        <Spacer size={10} />
        To solve these problems, we need to define a <Em>scrollable area</Em>,
        instead of using the viewport.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        This component is doing an awful lot. It feels like we could extract a
        couple components from this. Refactoring it would not only make it
        easier to follow/understand, but it would make it more reusable.
      </ListItem>
    </List>
    <Paragraph>
      Let's fix these problems. Here's a refactored version:
    </Paragraph>
    <LiveEditableCode
      id="react-scroll-flattener-refactored"
      gistId="e568721ed56b040e05e101874ca2b799"
      scope={{ getInterpolatedValue, PropTypes }}
      size="extra-wide"
      code={reactScrollFlattenerRefactoredCode}
      maxHeight={650}
    />
    <Paragraph>
      Ahh, much nicer! The effect is more pleasant as the flattening animation
      happens within a smaller scroll window, and the code is easier to parse.
      As a bonus, our <InlineCode>BezierCurve</InlineCode> and{' '}
      <InlineCode>ScrollArea</InlineCode> components are generic, so they could
      be useful in totally different contexts.
    </Paragraph>
    <Spacer size={25} />
    <SectionSubHeading anchorId="another-note-on-perforamnce">
      Another note on performance
    </SectionSubHeading>
    <Paragraph>
      The two versions above were written without any concern for performance.
      As it turns out, the performance is not so bad; on my low-end Chromebook,
      it stutters a little bit from time to time but mostly runs at 60fps. On my
      sluggish iPhone 6, it runs well enough (the biggest issue on mobile is
      that the browser address bar changes on scroll. Because of that, it may be
      wise to disable scroll-based things like this altogether on mobile).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      That said, your mileage may vary. If you want to improve performance,
      there are a few ways this could be optimized:
    </Paragraph>
    <List>
      <ListItem>
        <TextLink href="https://codeburst.io/throttling-and-debouncing-in-javascript-b01cad5c8edf">
          Throttle
        </TextLink>{' '}
        the scroll-handler in <InlineCode>ScrollArea</InlineCode> that it only
        fires every 20ms or so. This is to calm down certain touch-screen or
        trackpad interfaces that can fire far more often than is required.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        One of the more expensive parts of this effect is that we're interacting
        with the DOM, via{' '}
        <InlineCode>
          <TextLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect">
            getBoundingClientRect
          </TextLink>
        </InlineCode>
        , on every scroll event. Ideally, we could cache the position of our{' '}
        <InlineCode>ScrollArea</InlineCode> on mount, and then check the current
        scroll distance against this value.
        <br />
        <Spacer size={10} />
        Unfortunately, this method opens up new problems. It assumes that
        nothing between the top of the document and your BÃ©zier curve will
        change height, since our calculations assume a static distance between
        the two. Mobile browsers like iOS Safari will hide their chrome as you
        scroll down, so we'd have to factor that in as well.
        <br />
        <Spacer size={10} />
        It's far from impossible, but it wasn't worth the trouble for me, given
        that performance was satisfactory on the devices I'm targeting.
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        By storing
        <InlineCode>scrollRatio</InlineCode> in state and re-rendering whenever
        it changes, React needs some time to work out how the DOM has changed as
        a result of the scroll.
        <br />
        <Spacer size={10} />
        The refactor to extract several components, while very good for DX and
        reusability, also means that React has a slightly more complex tree to
        reconcile.
        <br />
        <Spacer size={10} />
        This all sounds a bit scary, but as we discovered earlier, React's
        reconciliation process is very quick on small trees like this. The cost
        of the refactor was negligible on my chromebook.
        <br />
        <Spacer size={10} />
        If you really need to extract every drop of performance, you could work
        with the DOM directly, by setting the new <InlineCode>
          path
        </InlineCode>{' '}
        instructions using <InlineCode>setAttribute</InlineCode>. Note that
        you'd need to store everything in 1 component again.
